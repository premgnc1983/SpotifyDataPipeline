# SpotifyDataPipeline
# Spotify Data Engineering Project - Data Pipeline

Introduction

The goal of this project is to create an end-to-end data pipeline that integrates with the Spotify API, extracts data from a specific playlist, processes it, and loads it into Google Cloud Storage and Google BigQuery. The pipeline is designed to be fully automated using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services.

The project consists of several components, including data extraction, transformation, data movement, and loading into BigQuery. Each component plays a crucial role in ensuring the data is processed efficiently, organized, and readily available for analysis.
